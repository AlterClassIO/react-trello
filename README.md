## Create-react-app

This project uses the popular [create-react-app (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/) command to setup a modern React application. This way we can focus on the code itself, and not worry about configuring many build tools. 

The [package.json](https://github.com/AlterClassIO/react-trello/blob/master/package.json) file provides four scripts:

- `start`: 
- `build`: 
- `test`: 
- `eject`:
